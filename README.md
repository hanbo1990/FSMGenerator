# MealyFSMGenerator ([Mealy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine))

> version: [0.3.0](https://github.com/hanbo1990/FSMGenerator/tree/master)

This mealy state machine generator will **generates c code together with its unit test** from:
* [draw.io](https://www.draw.io) graph if the user likes to draw the design in format of picture. Generating from png not supported in current version of drawio but will come soon. [Example here.](#Example-drawio)
* [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) dot file if the user likes to draw graph in format of code. This allows more readable version tracking. [Example here.](#Example-graphviz)
 
The generator is written in a modular way, so it can easily extended to support other languages and other input sources.

Key words used in the state machine generator are **state**, **condition** and **transition function**. It can describe the mealy state machine behavior: In state A, condition occurs, state machine should call a transition function and go to state B.

## How to use

```bash
'main.py -t <input type> -i <pathToInputFile> -n <StateMachineName>

    -t : input type, now 'dot' or 'drawio' supported. defaulted to  'drawio'.

    -i : path to the file, *.xml requried for drawio and *.dot required for dot

    -n : Name of generated state machine
```

For input type drawio, python dependencies lxml and bs4 are required.

### Example Drawio

#### Step 1: Create the state machine graph.

State machine in draw.io can be created following the example given in below:

![Example](https://i.postimg.cc/SQVM4Tzx/example.png)

Patterns to follow:

> 1. States should start with unique number
> 2. Condition should start with unique number
> 3. Transition with single direction arrow should start from one state to another state. 
> 4. Each transition line should come with condition and transition function in a new line.
> 5. Condition and transition function must be created on the transition line (not creating a text and move to the line).

Once the graph is generated, use drawio build-in export function to export the graph in xml format by:

```bash
File->Export As->xml
```

**ï¼­ake sure don't select compressed.**

#### Step 2: Generate the code

By calling:

```bash
main.py -i <pathToXML> -n <StateMachineName>
```

After this step, you should be able to find the result in **Result** folder where you execute the main file.

#### Step 3: Execute Unit Test

In Result/unit_test/ folder, execute following command:

```bash
ceedling
```

You should not see any reported error.

The Unit test is based on [ceedling](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/ceedling) which checks:

> 1. If the state number is same as the one in the graph. 
> 2. If the condition number is same as the one in the graph.
> 3. If the transition function is the same as the one in the graph.
> 4. Size of the Transition table is not changed.
> 5. The transition parameters (state, condition, next state, transition function) is same as the one in the graph. 

By enabling this unit_test, any manual change (exception is filling in the function slots) to the generated files will trigger a unit test failure.

### Example graphviz

graphviz is quite straight forward. Make sure at least you have states section and transitions section as below.

```bash
digraph G {
    splines=polyline
    node [style=filled];
    
    /* States */
    state_start [label="1START"]
    state_connecting [label="2CONNECTING"]
    state_connected [label="3CONNECTED"]
    
    /* transitions */
    state_start -> state_start[label="1NONE\nCheckIfTimeToConnect"]
    state_start -> state_connecting[label="2READY_TO_CONNECT\nConnect"]
    state_connecting -> state_start[label="3CONNECT_FAIL\nReset"]
    state_connecting -> state_start[label="4DISCONNECTED\nReset"]
    state_connecting -> state_connected[label="5CONNECT_SUCCESS\nNULL"]
    state_connected -> state_connected[label="1NONE\nSayHello"]
    state_connected -> state_start[label="4DISCONNECTED\nReset"]
}
```

Example and its preview looks like below.

![graphviz](https://i.postimg.cc/KvF57kHz/dot.png)

```bash
fsmgen.py -t dot -i Example/example.dot -n EXAMPLE
```

Will generate the expected results.
